# Ownership and Borrowing

Ownership and borrowing are fundamental concepts in Rust that ensure memory safety and prevent common programming errors. Here's a breakdown at various skill levels:

- **Basic Idea:**
    - Each value in Rust has a single owner.
    - The owner is responsible for the value's lifetime and deallocation (cleaning up memory).
    - When the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically dropped (memory is released).

- **Ownership and lifetimes:**
    - The Rust compiler ensures that borrowed data is valid for as long as the reference is used.
    - Lifetimes (like `'static`) can be specified to annotate how long a reference is valid.

- **Ownership and smart pointers:**
    - Explore techniques like `Box` and `Rc` (reference counting) for managing ownership in more complex scenarios.
    - Deep dive into the borrow checker and advanced ownership concepts in the Rust documentation.
