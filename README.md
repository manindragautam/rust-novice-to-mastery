# Rust: Novice to Mastery ðŸ“š

The primary purpose of this repository is to document my progress, learning experiences, and insights gained while delving into Rust. Through this book, I aim to create a comprehensive resource that covers various aspects of Rust programming, from novice level to mastery level.

## What's Inside

- **Code Examples**: Each chapter includes code examples that demonstrate different Rust concepts and features.
<!-- - **Exercises**: Practice makes perfect! Find exercises at the end of each chapter to reinforce your learning. -->
- **Additional Resources**: Explore supplementary materials such as useful links, recommended readings, and tutorials to deepen your understanding of Rust.

## How to Use

Feel free to navigate through the chapters sequentially or jump to specific topics based on your interest or learning goals. Run the code examples directly within the book to see Rust in action!
